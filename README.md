## Part 1: Responsive Page Build: 

## The goals of this exercise are:

* Replicate the mock up provided 
* Make it responsive / mobile friendly
- The mockup should be compatible with all devices and you can adjust the layout  / spacing as you see fit to make sure it works well on those devices. 
- Suggestion: go with the mobile first approach per section then work in 2-3 media queries that you will support.

* Bonus: Try out some sort of CSS3 animation on the ‘ADD TO CART’ button
* Double Bonus: If you have the time please feel free to add in any creative functionality. 

## Unresolved Issues:
* There are errors with responsiveness despite starting with mobile first design(worked previously but as it stands is not fully responsive). I need to go back and properly fix Bootstrap grid dimensions and css.
* Semantic HTML - still working to fix errors that were flagged from HTML validator
* CSS Validation - still working to fix errors like improper usage of "rem" and "em"
* Need to build out the rest of the sections, including JS and cart animation
* Fix font size and margins
